# üì¶ VStore - Product Service

This is the **Product Service** for the VStore microservices-based e-commerce platform. It manages all aspects of products, including CRUD operations, stock, ratings, and search. It uses **Redis** for caching to improve performance.

This service registers itself with the **Eureka Server** and is accessible via the **API Gateway**. It is a core part of the [VStore project](https://github.com/your-username/VStore).
